### **Technical requirements (50 pts):**

**Basic JavaScript code (20 pts):**

**Two public Web APIs integration (20 pts):**

* Ensure you include a disclaimer stating that the public/third-party services generate the generated contents below and that you are not responsible.

## What I Learned: 
For this project, I learned how to style and craft a compelling, professional looking website. I also learned how to host my site on the internet (which is very cool) so others can see it. I figured out how to use Ajax to render images from the internet / APIs and put them on the page. I also improved my usage of styling, and CSS classes to make a performant but nice looking website. 

Additionally, I gained experience integrating third party APIs and handling asynchronous JavaScript. I also learned to manage user sessions with cookies. Working with frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery helped me understand how to build responsive and interactive web pages more efficiently. Overall, this project enhanced my web development skills and gave me practical experience in deploying real-world applications.
